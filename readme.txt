Webmaster.Net Post Quality Analyzer is a simple lite-weight plugin to analyze the quality of your posts. 
 
== Description == 

Writing is an art, it requires a creative approach, but there are many strategies you can follow to come up with high-quality posts over and over again. If you want to boost your SEO traffic, you should 
make sure your posts are of a certain quality, for example best practice is to have multiple headlines, multiple images, a word count higher than 500 and you should FREQUENTLY update your articles to keep them relevant
and rank high in the search engines.

= Update Low Quality Posts, Gain Organic Traffic =

I published a lot of low quality articles over the years with poor results. My most popular articles all met certain criteria - and it's not exactly rocket science, all you need is a good strategy, work hard, 
and do your homework. People will dig your content and you get more organic traffic. With this plugin you can quickly find low-quality posts, update them and even keep track of your progress via tidy Excel files. 
This will help you to get more traffic in the long run. 

= SEO: Define Low Quality, Medium Quality, High Quality =

In the plugin settings you can define what you consider low, medium and high quality. Some examples you can copy and paste: 

* Word Count: Low 300, Medium 400, Optimal 600+

* Headline Count: Low 0, Medium 2, Optimal 3+
